h2. Security

The template creates also a security group for the log server instance. The group has the following inbound connections enabled.

|_. Protocol |_. Port |_. Range                    |_. Service     |_. Description                     |
| TCP        | 22     | The value for @AccessFrom@ | SSH           | SSH access                        |
| TCP        | 80     | The value for @AccessFrom@ | HTTP          | To access the Kibana3 frontend    |
| TCP        | 5544   | The value for @AccessFrom@ | Logstash      | To send log messages via Syslog   |
| UDP        | 5544   | The value for @AccessFrom@ | Logstash      | To send log messages via Syslog   |
| TCP        | 9200   | The value for @AccessFrom@ | Elasticsearch | To send log messages via Logstash |

The single access permissions should be changed after the instance has been created. The initial settings are only available, to restrict the access to a secure network, during instance initialization.

h2. Logging

The template creates a log file for the setup. If something goes wrong then disable the *Rollback on Failure* option in the *Advanced options*. Then look at the file @/var/log/setup.log@ for reasons why the creation failed.
